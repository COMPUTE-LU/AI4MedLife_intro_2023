Mattias Ohlsson, Faculty of Science, Lund University


## Attendance
It is not mandatory to attend all parts of the course to receive a pass grade as the course material will be shared and can be studied independently. However, if you are going to miss more than half a day, please get in contact with the course leader. Attendance at the examination is mandatory but if needed, an alternative examination date can be set up.


## Examination
Grades are pass/fail. The examination consists of a project assignment. Presentations will take place on Jan 22 or 23, 2024.


You are encouraged to discuss the course materials and your project ideas with your classmates. However, all work you submit must be your own. Shared projects or re-submission of prior course or research work you have created yourself is not allowed.

This is encouraged:

- Getting feedback on project ideas from fellow course members, friends or colleagues
- Discussing general approaches to solving the tasks with others
- Looking at reserach articles, tutorials or github repos to understand how others have approached similar tasks
- Re-using graphical elements (e.g. diagrams, cartoons) you or others have created in other contexts for the introduction part of your presentation (with attribution)


This is is not allowed and constitutes plagiarism:

- Submitting the same or highly similar presentation, report, review or code as another course member. A mere change of the research question is not sufficiently different either if the project strategy is otherwise identical.
- Copying all or almost all presentation content from other sources or from one of your previous courses, thesis works or research projects
- Copying text sections for your report or slides for your presentation from other sources

Basically, follow common sense and sound scientific and educational practice. If in doubt, please ask!
